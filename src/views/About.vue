    <h1 class="subheading grey--text">About the Creators</h1>
    <p>On July 20th 2019, Jayden Ryan had an idea for an app and asked her dad to build.  Her Dad (Jeff) asked her to draw(plan) her idea so they could work together on it.</h1>
    <br>
    <p> While building this app we wanted to give kids like Jayden the ability to do the following:</h1>
          <ol>
            <li> Come up with a idea. (Create a Reward)</li>
            <li> Plan how to accomplish the idea. (Create chores)</li>
            <li> Get others to help. (Agree on rewards)</li>
            <li> Finish the chores and enjoy the rewards. (Mark Chores completed and Rewards given)</li>
          </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>With that in mind, we created an app for kids.  The app can be used to track rewards provided by parents and how the reward can be earned. It can also be used to track child's can set their own rewards and get them.
